                If youâ€™re using this app maybe you were recently diagnosed as autistic,

                you know or care about is autistic. For any of the above, Congratulations! 
                You have been given a wonderful opportunity to better get to know yourself or

                Understanding Autism through the lens of Neurodiversity is an important first

                Not all Autistic people are the same, so rather than provide a singular 'Guide to Autism', your toolkit
                is a personalized selection of resources that are relevant to you and your and support needs. You can
                even add your own favorite online resources that are not currently in our directory.

                A positive understanding of one's neurotype along with a supportive community are building blocks to living a fulfilling autistic life.

                with those you are closest to.

                By spreading more accurate information about the autistic experience to those who can 
                make a direct impact in our lives, the goal is to help build strong support systems
                around autistic people, and to empower our communities to be neurodiversity-affirming spaces that are safe and accomodating to everyone.
